# OPA Prod issue tracker
=======

This is the project for tracking OPA issues. To create, view, or discuss issues, **[go directly to the tracker](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/OPAProd/issues)**. This tracker is visible to all members of the [OPA Prod team](https://github.com/orgs/usnationalarchives/teams/opa-prod).

## Label and milestones

There are several labels which can be used to organize issues. Milestones can also be used to assign issues to a release. As well, issues can be assigned to particular team members if they are needed for decisionmaking or some other reason. Issues can be closed once resolved (or the team decides against them).

Currently, [the only milestone](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/OPAProd/milestones) is `R1P2`. The idea is that issues that are scheduled for inclusion in the next release will assigned to `R1P2`.

Use labels like `requirement` if it will need additional requirements, or `design` if not. You can also mark issues as `open question`, `trivial`, `later`, and so on. Any member of the team can [view or change all labels](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/OPAProd/labels).

For example, here is the first issue in the tracker: "*[Make all fields sortable in the API](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/OPAProd/issues/1)*".

## GitHub help

GitHub uses *[Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)* for formatting in issues. It's also how this file is displaying as formatted in the browser (hence the `.md` in `README.md`). You can use Markdown to hyperlink text, make bold and italic text, section headers, bulleted or numbered lists, and so on.
